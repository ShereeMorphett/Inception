<!-- events: This block is used to configure settings related to events processing, such as connections and timeouts. 
	Worker_connections 1024;: Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections that each worker process can handle.
	In this example, each worker process can handle up to 1024 connections. -->

<!-- sendfile on;: Enables or disables the use of the sendfile system call for serving files. When set to on, it allows Nginx to use more efficient file serving mechanisms.
tcp_nopush on;: Enables or disables the use of the TCP_NOPUSH socket option. When set to on, it optimizes the sending of TCP packets by reducing the number of small packets sent.
tcp_nodelay on;: Enables or disables the use of the TCP_NODELAY option. When set to on, it disables Nagle's algorithm, improving the latency of small packets.
keepalive_timeout 65;: Sets the timeout for keep-alive connections. If there is no activity within the specified time, the connection is closed.
types_hash_max_size 2048;: Sets the maximum size of the hash tables used for storing MIME types. This helps optimize the lookup of MIME types.
server: This block defines the settings for a particular virtual server.
listen 8080;: Specifies the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests. In this case, it's set to port 8080.
server_name localhost;: Defines the server's name. Requests with this server name will be processed by this server block.
location / { ... }: This block defines the configuration for the root location (i.e., the default route). It specifies the root directory for serving static files and sets the default index file to index.html.
error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;: Specifies custom error pages for HTTP status codes 500, 502, 503, and 504.
location = /50x.html { ... }: Defines the location for serving the custom error page /50x.html in case of errors. -->
